IPFS Computing Router is a CDN that enables users to fetch datasets from the closest SP to computing resources and perform computing jobs. If the data is not found on the SP, it will fetch the data from the closest SP and pay for the retrieval and hosting cost via FEVM contract.


## Installation

```shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Computing

A Sample AI training job _image_classification.ipynb_ can be found in [computing](computing) folder

## Setup MCS environment file
This setup is for setting up the wallet for pay mcs backup cost.

Create an **.env** file 
```shell
wallet_address = ""
private_key = ""
web3_api = "https://matic-testnet-archive-rpc.bwarelabs.com"
```

## Gateway and Computing result

The main script compares two IPFS gateways:

```shell
https://mcs.filswan.com 
https://ipfs.io
```

The script will choose the one has less latency and backup the computing result to it.

```html
mcs.filswan.com Montr√©al
ipfs.io San Francisco
ipfs_io_response_time 0.091187
mcs_response_time 0.084746
Chose mcs gateway

```

If MCS is selected ,it will show your backup on MCS as follows:
